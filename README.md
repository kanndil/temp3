# Temp3 Project

A comprehensive example project demonstrating modern development practices and ASIC design workflows.

## Overview

This repository contains a sample digital design project that showcases:
- RTL design using SystemVerilog
- Verification using cocotb/pyuvm
- Synthesis and place-and-route using OpenLane
- Integration with Caravel SoC framework

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Clean, reusable RTL modules
- **Comprehensive Verification**: Full coverage testbenches using cocotb
- **Open Source Tools**: Compatible with Yosys, OpenLane, and other OSS EDA tools
- **Documentation**: Complete design documentation and user guides
- **CI/CD Ready**: Automated testing and build workflows

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Yosys synthesis suite
- OpenLane flow
- cocotb verification framework
- Make build system

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kanndil/temp3.git
   cd temp3
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run basic tests:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

4. Synthesize the design:
   ```bash
   make synth
   ```

## Usage

### Running Simulations

```bash
# Run all testbenches
make sim

# Run specific test
make sim TEST=basic_functionality

# Generate coverage report
make coverage
```

### Synthesis and Implementation

```bash
# Synthesize RTL
make synth

# Run place and route
make pnr

# Generate final reports
make reports
```

## Design Modules

### Core Components

- **Main Controller**: Central control logic
- **Data Path**: Arithmetic and logic operations  
- **Interface**: Communication protocols (SPI, UART, etc.)
- **Memory Controller**: RAM/ROM access management

### Key Features

- Clock domain crossing handling
- Low power design techniques
- DFT (Design for Test) ready
- Configurable parameters

## Verification

The project uses modern verification methodologies:

- **cocotb**: Python-based testbenches
- **pyuvm**: UVM-like verification framework
- **Functional Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage collection
- **Constrained Random Testing**: Advanced stimulus generation

### Test Categories

- Unit tests for individual modules
- Integration tests for system-level functionality
- Regression test suite
- Performance benchmarks
